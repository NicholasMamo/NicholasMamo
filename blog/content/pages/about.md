Hi, I’m Nicholas Mamo, and I am a published researcher and PhD graduate in Artificial Intelligence.

I started this blog because research is rarely accessible.
On this blog, I want to share my research and work in a way that anyone can understand it.

My research area is Artificial Intelligence and, more specifically, Event Tracking.
Event tracking is an area of computational journalism (more specifically, of news gathering) that creates timelines of events, similarly to [The Guardian's minute-by-minute reports](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/minutebyminute).

I have been studying Artificial Intelligence since 2014, and event tracking since 2016.
In fact, event tracking was the subject of my undergraduate dissertation, and it was again the subject of my postgraduate dissertation.
Eventually, in 2020, it became the subject of my doctoral thesis.
During my PhD, I hypothesized (and demonstrated) that many of the problems facing event tracking could be solved if only we understood events better.

Over the years, I broadened my research focus.
I have experience in event summarization, event modeling and mining, and other research areas dedicated to understanding events—I even started a research task: Automatic Participant Detection.
This blog is where I write about my research in this area and other projects.
You can read more about why I started this blog in [this post]({{< ref "/about-events" >}} "About events").
